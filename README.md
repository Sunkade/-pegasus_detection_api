 Pegasus Detection API
The purpose of the project is to create a softaware that detect the spyware that enable every user to know if their gadget has pegasus which will enable them to detect it and also uninstall the spyware for the user.
The project idea of developing a backend system to detect and analyze Pegasus spyware is not entirely unique, as cybersecurity researchers and organizations have been working on detecting and analyzing Pegasus spyware for several years. However, implementing a project like this specifically with FastAPI and creating a structured API for various analysis methods (network traffic analysis, memory forensics, file system analysis, and mobile device analysis) can still be a novel and valuable contribution, especially in an educational or smaller-scale professional context.

Unique Aspects of my Project
Integration of Multiple Analysis Methods:

Combining network traffic analysis, memory forensics, file system analysis, and mobile device analysis in a single API is a comprehensive approach that is not commonly found in publicly available tools.
Use of Modern Technologies:

Using FastAPI for creating the API provides a modern, efficient framework that is gaining popularity but is not yet as widely adopted as older frameworks like Flask or Django.
This project is designed to detect and analyze Pegasus spyware using various methods including network traffic analysis, memory forensics, file system analysis, and mobile device analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pegasus_detection_api.git
   cd pegasus_detection_api
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file and add your secret key:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level info
   ```

6. (Optional) Build and run using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t pegasus_detection_api .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 pegasus_detection_api
   ```

## Endpoints

- `/network/analyze`: Analyze network traffic
- `/memory/analyze`: Analyze memory dump
(POST /file/analyze): Analyze file system images.
Mobile Device Analysis (POST /mobile/analyze): Analyze mobile device backups.
Environment Variables
Specifies any required environment variables:

SECRET_KEY: Secret key for JWT authentication.
Utility Functions
Describes utility functions used within the project:

save_upload_file: Saves the uploaded file to a temporary directory.
validate_token: Validates JWT tokens for authentication.
Project Structure
Outlines the project's directory and file structure, showing how the files are organized.

Contributing
Encourages contributions to the project and explains how to contribute, usually by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
Also is a web application backend it provides a service system for detecting a analysis of spyware user can interact with this backend system through. It request typically made via a web interface or Api client the backend doesn't include a user interface it serves as the underlying interface sofware or web application require pegasus an as an open source contribution for all developers:
